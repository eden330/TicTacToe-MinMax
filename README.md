# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm in JavaFX

This is a Java Maven project implementing the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Minimax algorithm for AI player, built with JavaFX for the user interface.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid 
with their respective symbols, usually 'X' and 'O',with the goal of getting three of their
symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

This project extends the basic Tic Tac Toe game by implementing an AI player using the Minimax algorithm. 
The Minimax algorithm is a decision rule used in game theory for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. 
In the context of Tic Tac Toe, the AI player uses Minimax to determine the best move based on the current state of the game board.
